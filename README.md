# Portfolio
A project that is also my portfolio.

It contains information about my education, experience and projects undertaken by me.

To create it such technologies were used as:
- HTML,
- CSS,
- Javascript,
- Bootstrap,
- JQuery,
- matchHeight library.

Moreover, a contact form made in PHP language was embedded.
## The origin of the project

I have always been interested in FrontEnd technologies. My current work is in web development based on Joomla CMS. In addition, I was oriented towards these technologies by my computer science studies, during which I was most eager to do this type of projects. It was natural to create this type of project, where I could play with my most favorite technologies. At the same time I wanted the created portfolio to say as much as possible about my person.

## How it works?

The website is made in onepager form. There is a header at the top of the page. When the page is scrolled, it turns into a sticky. Very importantly, this happens only below the slide. It is also worth mentioning that resolutions below 991px do not have sticky header. Below is a slider taken from Bootstrap library. Then an about me section has been added. Graphics in it has infinite zoom animation. The Education and Work Experience section has three boxes whose content describes these aspects of my life. A hover animation was imposed on their graphics as well. The next section contains technologies and information about their knowledge presented in the form of stars from 1 to 5. Active stars are loaded sequentially thanks to the written "sleep" function and asynchronous function called by scrolling. In the background you can see a dynamic background composed of HTML, CSS and Javascript, which can be disabled with the button placed on the right side of the header. The parallax located below has the motto that I live by. The section below has short information about my projects. After hovering over the box it appears with a button redirecting to the given project. This section is scrollable to the right and to the left. Below it there is a contact form (not working on GIthub platform ;) ).

The page was adjusted according to RWD standards. Moreover, the basic rules of SEO optimization were not omitted, such as graphics in ".webp" format, appropriate alt's for graphics.
